🔹 Task 1: Launch & Login

Open naukri.com.

Handle multiple popups (Naukri opens several).

Locate and fill email/username and password fields.

Click Login and verify successful login by checking profile icon.

🔹 Task 2: Profile Update (Resume Upload)

Navigate to My Naukri → Profile.

Automate resume upload by selecting a .docx/.pdf file.

Verify the "Resume updated successfully" message.

🔹 Task 3: Job Search Automation

Navigate to Jobs → Search Jobs.

Enter keywords like "Automation Test Engineer Selenium Java".

Apply filters:

Location = Bangalore/Hyderabad/Remote

Experience = 5–10 years

Verify that filtered jobs are displayed.

🔹 Task 4: Save Job Links

From search results, extract:

Job Title

Company Name

Apply Link

Save them into a CSV/Excel for tracking.

🔹 Task 5: Automate Apply

⚠️ Careful here: Direct automation of "Apply" can sometimes trigger bot-detection. So do it safely.

Click on a job listing.

Click Apply button.

Fill in details if a form appears (sometimes it auto-applies).

Capture confirmation message like "Your application has been submitted."

🔹 Task 6: Bulk Apply with Conditions

Loop through 10–15 job links.

Apply only if:

Job Title contains “QA Automation” / “SDET”

Location matches preference

Skip others.

Log all applications into a CSV (Job Title, Company, Date Applied).

🔹 Task 7: Notifications / Reports

After applying, generate a summary report of:

Total jobs applied today

Success count vs failures

Optionally send it via email/Slack using Playwright + NodeMailer.

👉 Pro Tip:

Use page.waitForSelector wisely since Naukri has dynamic ads and modals.

Add stealth-like waits/random delays to mimic human behavior.

Store cookies/session to avoid logging in every time.
